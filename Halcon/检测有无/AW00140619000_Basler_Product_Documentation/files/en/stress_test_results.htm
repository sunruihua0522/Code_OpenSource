<h1>Stress Test Results</h1>
<p class="teaser">To ensure stability when used in a normal environment, 
 Basler cameras are tested under exaggerated levels of stress.</p>
<p>Cameras were submitted to an independent mechanical testing laboratory 
 and subjected to the stress tests listed below. The mechanical stress 
 tests were performed on selected camera models. After mechanical testing, 
 the cameras exhibited no detectable physical damage and produced normal 
 images during standard operational testing.</p>
